	###1 -Project's Presentation

		This project is a chatbot and his goal is to help you find a park in Prague that suits you. This chatbot will find you the best park to do your jogging
		or the more beautifull see spot, the second use of this chatbot is to find the champion of ixtal your thinking of with some questions.

	###2 -Technologie use

		For this project, we used a programmation language named Clojure. We also worked on GitHub.

	###3 -How to launch

		To launch our Chatbot, you need to copy the code from Github, then you paste it on a text editor. If you don't have REPL activate, you need to start
		it. Personally we use Visual Studio Code, and to activate REPL you need to to click on the REPL logo (the logo is on the bottom left of your screen).
		Then when your REPL is activate, you need to write : " discusspark" between parenthesis on your command prompt and the code about Pragues parks is launch. If 	
		you want to talk about the champion of ixtal you need to write "discussixtal".
